            <br>
            <p class="homeInfoText">Here at Broken Scales we are focused on the disparity in Standardized Testing. Tests like the SAT are not only a large factor in college admissions, but also merit based scholarships and more. The SAT has been a chance for students who donâ€™t go to elite high schools to get noticed. The sad fact? There are huge scoring gaps between different classes and races, gaps that directly mirror the income inequality between racial groups.</p>

                <li>The gap is most dramatic on the math portion of the SAT, where less than 1/3 of Hispanic/Latino students and 1/4 of Black students meet the benchmark (over 1/2 of White students and 4/5 of Asian students meet this benchmark)</li>
                <br>
